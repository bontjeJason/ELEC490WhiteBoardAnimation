			ELEC490 Whiteboard Animation Software
======================================================================================


Whiteboard animations are a growing trend on YouTube as an effective way to teach 
and an effective medium to deliver a message, and as such have the potential to 
revolutionize the way presentations everywhere are given. However these presentations 
are extremely time consuming and limited in their capability because they require 
everything to be designed by hand using stop frame animation. Our project is to 
create a software program that gives the client a wide selection of tools and 
functions that allows them to easily and quickly create a whiteboard animation style
presentation, all on the user’s computer. This will let the user choose from a wide
variety of images via clip-art, personal collection, or essentially whatever they
can find online in a way that is similar to PowerPoint, freeing the user from the
need to be a talented artist while also increasing the speed at which presentations 
can be completed. This document highlights the work breakdown structure of the project 
as well as highlights potential problems and their associated mitigation strategies and 
the impact of the project. The project is currently on schedule with system architecture 
designing and functional requirements to begin once research is completed.
